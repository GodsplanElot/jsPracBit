//Javascript class is used as a constructor for creating objects. for example lets create a constructor for making pizza

//basic class syntax
/* class Pizza {
    constructor() {
        this.size = "medium";
        this.crust = "orginal";
    }
    bake () {
        console.log(`Baking a ${this.size} ${this.crust} crust pizza`)
    }
} */

// Now we use all this above as a constructor to create objects, e.g below.

/* const myPizza = new Pizza ()
myPizza.bake() */
